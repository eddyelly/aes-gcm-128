# AES-GCM-128 Encryption 

Welcome to the **AES-GCM-128 **! This project provides a web-based interface to demonstrate the functionality of AES-GCM-128 encryption, a widely used cryptographic algorithm that ensures data confidentiality and integrity.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Easily encrypt and decrypt messages using AES-GCM-128.
- **Secure Key Management**: Generate and manage 128-bit encryption keys.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure the integrity of your data with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eddyelly/aes-gcm-128-simulator.git
   cd aes-gcm-128-simulator

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start

4. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

**Usage**
- 1. Enter your message: Input the text you wish to encrypt.
- 2. Generate a key: Use the built-in key generator to create a secure 128-bit key.
- 3. Encrypt: Click the "Encrypt" button to secure your message.
- 4. Decrypt: Use the same key to decrypt the message and verify its integrity.
